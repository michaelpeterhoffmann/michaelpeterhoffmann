**`Researcher and Software Developer`**

I'm an interdisciplinary researcher and software developer, holding a Master's in Computer Science (awarded in 2023) and a Doctorate in Social Anthropology (completed in 2012). My approach to coding projects begins at the core, involving comprehensive planning, design, and tackling real-world challenges through code implementation. As a published author, I've contributed to the academic sphere with two anthropological monographs, an edited volume, and over twenty research papers spanning social anthropology and computer sciences.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Michael's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 My coding journey commenced during my undergraduate years in Computer Science from 2000 to 2003 at TU Munich in Germany. Toward the end of my Bachelor's program, I developed an additional passion: the study of social sciences. This led me then to pursue a program in social anthropology, marking the beginning of my career as a researcher in social anthropology. This path took me to the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I earned a Master's in Anthropology and Development Studies followed by a Ph.D. in Social Anthropology in 2012. Upon completing my doctorate, I returned to Germany and secured positions at various esteemed institutions, including the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, the Global South Studies Center at the University of Cologne, RE:WORK at Humboldt University, and ultimately a DFG-sponsored post-doc at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg.

Throughout these times as a post-doc, however, my interest in coding and software development reignited, which then led me to enroll in a Master's program in Computer Science at FU Berlin, culminating in obtaining my degree in October 2023. Ever since I have a desire for knowledge in computer science-related subjects, and also began delving into interdisciplinary projects that sit at the intersection of anthropology and computer sciences. Feel free to explore the projects I'm currently involved in below!
