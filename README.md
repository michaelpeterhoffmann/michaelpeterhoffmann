**`Researcher and Software Developer`**

I'm a researcher and software developer with an academic background in computer science (M.Sc.2023) and social anthropology (PhD 2012). My coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life
problems with code. I'm a published author as well and published two anthropological monographs, one editd volume and more than a dozend research papers.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Michael's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey during my Bachelor studies in Computer Sciences from 2000 to 2003. In the last year of the Bachelor I had another desire - to study social sciences. I eventually signed up in a program in social anthropology, and began
   a career as a researcher in social anthropology. This led me to the London School of Economics and Political Sciences where I obtained a Masters in Anthropology and Development Studies and a Phd in Social Anthropology. After finishing my doctorate
   I returned to Germany, and managed to get four different post-docs at the Max-Planck Institut for Social Anthropology, the Global South Studies Center at the University of Cologne, RE:WORK at Humboldt University, and finally a DFG-sponsored post-doc at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. But throughout my time, my curiosity towards coding and software development grew again, and I signed up for a master's in computer sciences at the FU Berlin. I obtained a master's degree from the FU Berlin in October 2023. I have a burning desire to learn more about computer sciency related topics, and also began on working on some interdisplinary projects that combine anthropology and computer sciences. Have a look at my projects below!
